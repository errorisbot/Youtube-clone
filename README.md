Youtube Website clone

Developed a fully functional front-end clone of YouTube, creating an interactive and user-friendly interface
with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Implemented a responsive layout that adapts to various devices and replicated key features such as video
thumbnails, navigation menus, and search functionality to match the original platform.
